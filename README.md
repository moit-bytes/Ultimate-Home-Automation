# Ultimate-Home-Automation
Turning on/off the lights,fans and appliances through switches were an old method.
With my project one can easily control the lights, fans and appliances sitting from any corner of the world.
All of you might be aware of the fact that in the present scenario the use of Internet of Things has risen to a great extent and its implementation can be seen in most of the fields.
My project is also an example of the same with new technological advancements implemented in it.
In this project I am going to show you how to Control multiple appliances through Google assistant from anywhere in the world,Monitoring devices from anywhere in the world -Automating home appliances(lights, fans , etc) 
For example, if you are out of your house for some work and you forgot to switch off your appliance then you can remotely access your appliances from any part of the world and make it on or off.
